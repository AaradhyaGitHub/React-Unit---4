# Layered Component Responsibility in React Applications

When building modern React applications, especially with Next.js and React Server Components, establishing clear separation of concerns is crucial for maintainable code. The pattern below demonstrates a powerful approach to handling data fetching, loading states, and error boundaries.

## The Three-Layer Pattern

```jsx
return (
  <main>
    <ErrorBoundary fallback={<p>Something went wrong :(</p>}>
      <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading users.....</p>}>
        <UsePromiseDemo usersPromise={fetchUsersPromise} />
      </Suspense>
    </ErrorBoundary>
  </main>
);
```

This structure creates a clear hierarchy of responsibilities:

### Layer 1: Data Fetching Component (UsePromiseDemo)

The innermost component is responsible for:

- Consuming promises with the `use` hook
- Rendering the UI once data is available
- Handling user interactions
- Managing component-specific state

This component shouldn't worry about handling loading states or catching errors - it should focus solely on rendering data and managing interactions.

### Layer 2: Loading State Management (Suspense)

The middle layer, `<Suspense>`, handles:

- Showing a fallback UI during data loading
- Automatically detecting when components are waiting for promises
- Transitioning between loading and loaded states smoothly
- Supporting multiple loading states when nested properly

Suspense creates a clear boundary between what users see while waiting and what they see when data is ready.

### Layer 3: Error Handling (ErrorBoundary)

The outermost layer catches any errors that might occur:

- Prevents the entire application from crashing
- Displays user-friendly error messages
- Isolates errors to specific parts of the UI
- Can potentially offer recovery options

## Benefits of This Approach

This pattern provides several key advantages:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each component has one clear job, making the code easier to understand and maintain.

2. **Progressive Enhancement**: The UI gracefully upgrades from loading states to full functionality.

3. **Resilience**: Errors in one component don't crash the entire application.

4. **Improved Developer Experience**: Clear boundaries make debugging and testing easier.

5. **Consistent User Experience**: Users always see appropriate feedback whether things are loading, succeeded, or failed.

## Real-world Implementation

In practice, you might implement this pattern with more sophisticated components:

```jsx
<ErrorBoundary fallback={<ErrorDisplay onRetry={() => refetchData()} />}>
  <Suspense fallback={<LoadingSkeletons count={5} />}>
    <DataComponent dataPromise={fetchDataPromise} onSuccess={handleSuccess} />
  </Suspense>
</ErrorBoundary>
```

This approach scales well as your application grows, allowing you to:

- Nest multiple Suspense boundaries for different sections
- Create specialized error handling for different components
- Reuse loading and error UI patterns throughout your application

## Integration with Next.js

While Next.js provides its own error handling mechanisms (like error.js files), this pattern offers finer-grained control within individual page components and sections. You can combine both approaches:

- Use Next.js route-based error handling for page-level issues
- Use this pattern for component-level issues within pages

By leveraging this three-layer approach, you create a robust foundation for applications that handle asynchronous operations gracefully, recover from errors effectively, and provide a seamless user experience.
